# How to start

Get started by downloading and adding the "Monitor" or "Monitor - Compact" to your game or application. Integrating is super easy - just include the performance monitor prefab in your initial scene, and you're good to go.

After adding the performance monitor prefab, you adjust its settings. You have the ability to specify if the performance monitor should be available exclusively in development mode and activate/deactivate monitoring components as desired. By default, the monitor can be activated in-game by pressing the F1 key, but you also have the freedom to set custom keys for this, providing a personalized monitoring experience.
