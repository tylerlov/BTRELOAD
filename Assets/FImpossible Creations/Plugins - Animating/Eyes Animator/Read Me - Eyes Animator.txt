Description:

Eyes Animator is component which will animate eye spheres to behave like real or to behave more cartoon like, it's up to you!

Eye movement is a small detail thing, but when it suddenly appear in your project, you can feel that it was truly missing.
Component have intuitive settings which you can use to design your custom movement for eyes.
Animation is procedural and constatly random - no repetitions, it's only using game object's rotation.

Algorithm is simulating eyes point of interest lag for more realism, which effect you can adjust with simple slider.
There is also random eyes movement simulation, with different presets: 
From calm through nervous to psychical cues - movement of eyes when someone is lying / trying to remember sound etc.

All you need to have are eyes sphere models or eye bones in your 3D model.

Main features:
-Includes interactive demo scenes
-Includes full source code with detailed commentary

- Quickly setup component with custom inspector
- Easily change target objects to follow by eyes
- Blend eye animation and effects you apply in component
- Easily set clamp ranges with inspector visualization

Changelog:

v2.0.3.3
- Moved 'auto find' methods from editor to runtime plugin

v2.0.3.2
- added possiblity to use additional blenshapes for blinking
- support for look angles at any head orientation (like upside down) for blendshape driven look animation
- fix: when eye was clamped, the lag was sometimes calculating its animation with delay
- Look start position is now calculated along with head position (Corrections -> Static Look Start Position)

v2.0.3.1
- There was found issue with weird eye rotations when using Eyes Lag and rotating character quickly
so Lag feature is using now different code

v2.0.3
- Added Blendshapes Support
- Added individual clamping support

v2.0.2
- Added Bones_Positions blinking mode
- Added Bones_Scale blinking mode

v2.0.1
- Updated implementation with look animator (check "Look Animator Implementation.txt")
- Changed how "EyesAnimatorAmount" parameter works - it disables all eyes animator features (including blinking)
- Eyes follow behaviour blend separated onto "Follow Target Amount" parameter. Now "Stop Look Above" have influence only on this (it will not disable random eyes movement)
- Demo scenes packed into .unitypackage
- Directories managed to work with assembly definitions also included .unitypackage with assembly definitions
- Fixed few logics with out of range detection
- Added "Go Out" factor for "Max Distance" parameter to avoid instant disabling/enabling eyes follow behaviour

v2.0.0
- Upgraded inspector GUI
- Removed Eyes Animator Blinking component, instead of it blinking is additional module to enable within Eyes Animator
If you was using blinking component, open "/Eyes Animator/Packages/" directory then import package, on top of your blinking package
will appear button "Convert to Eyes Animator V2" please do it on every blinking component you use and 
then you can remove "FEyesAnimatorBlinking.cs" file and "Eyes Animator/Editor/FEyesAnimatorBlinking_Editor.cs" file
- Upgraded implementation with my other package "Look Animator"
You just need to have look animator in project to make implementation appear in Eyes Animator inspector window

v1.0.7
- Added support to animate blinking with blenshapes on skinned mesh renderer
- Few upgrades and new parameter "Hold Closed Time"
- Added field "Optimizer with renderer" to stop EyesAnimator from computing algorithm when choosed renderer is not visible in camera view

v1.0.6
- Fixes for inspector window
- Now 'Auto Find' will not only try to find head bone but also eye bones and eyelids
- Variable 'RootFixer' removed because new rotation fixing algorithm is working universally

V1.0.5
- Some fixes for inspector window
- "EyeLids" list now will be automatically filled with objects from "Upper Eyelids" and "Lower Eyelids" lists
- Added button "Focus On Close Rotations" to help adjusting eyelids close rotations
- Added variable "Min Open Value" to blinking component so you can close character's eyes a little as default eyes pose
- Added guide gizmo arrows to help debug algorithm

V1.0.3
- Added 'Additional Eyelids Motion' for FEyesAnimatorBlinking component, so you can controll eyelids' opening a little when character is looking up and closing a bit when looking down - it gives more natural effect
- Added 'LagStiffness' variable for some more controll over lag effect

V1.0.2
- Added icon on the right inside hierarchy to easily find objects with attached EyesAnimator
- Added component menu so you will find Eyes Animator components also under "Add Component" > "FImpossible Creations" > "Eyes Animator"

V1.0.1
- Added prefabs for single eye setups of eye animator
- Few fixes for inspector windows
